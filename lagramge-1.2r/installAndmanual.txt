LAGRAMGE INSTALL

There is an install file in the files given but additionally some other steps have to be taken into account.


1) As said in the manual the system had to have lex/yacc packages and gfortran package and it should be able to compile gcc. In my case I am using clang.

2) In the makefile change the DHOME_DIR variable to the directory where the lagrange files are and in addition I changed the CC from gcc to clang, the -lfl flags to -ll and for g: $(OBJECTS1) I added the path of where the gfortran library is as it could not find it when I compiled and it should be something similar to this 
g: $(OBJECTS1)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(OBJECTS1) $(OBJECTS_ALG_717) -ll -lm -ldl -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib -lgfortran 
Also in the make file where the -shared flag is used it needs to be replaced with -dylib
	
3) Additionally in all the source files I changed the malloc.h library to malloc/malloc.h.

4) In the file  rgramm.y add as line 22: void function_def(char *ls, int ord);


After these changes if you follow the instruction numer 3 in the install.txt and copy and paste the gc, rg, g files from the src in the bin directory the example given in the manual.txt should work however when you run ./bin/g the first flag should be -g and not -l as insructed int he manual.txt
