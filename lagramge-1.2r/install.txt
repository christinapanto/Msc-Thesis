Lagramge has be only tested on Linux (various distributions) and
OSX. All attempts to install Lagramge on Cygwin have failed due
to the problems with dynamic library loading in runtime.

Go to ./src/ directory and edit the files Makefile and gc. In both
files, set the variable HOME_DIR to reflect the location where you
unpacked the archive. If your system in 64-bit, edit line 7 in the
"globals.h" file (remove word "long" from that line).

Run "make all".

If successful, copy the executable files "rg", "g", and "gc" to the
./bin/ directory and start using Lagramge.

On failure, check the following:

 (1) check that lex/yacc (and *not* flex/bison) package is installed
     on your system. I could not manage to compile Lagramge using
     flex/bison: you might however try, if you really want to.

 (2) gfortran package is installed on your system (note that gcc
     versionos 4+ include gfortran, so you might not need to install
     it separately). Note that the Fortran code for parameter fitting
     is already compiled (directory ./src/alg-717/), however Lagramge
     still need gfortran libraries in runtime.

 (3) In case of problems with linking the parameter fitting code, you
     should go to the ./src/TOMS-717/ directory and recompile the
	 sources. Run "make clean" and "make" there to re-compile and
     copy the object files to the ./src/alg-717/ directory, i.e., run
     "cp *.o ../alg-717/".

 (4) Lagramge uses shared library loading in runtime, which can cause
     problesm on SELinux systems (the error "cannot restore segment
     prot after reloc: Permission denied" is reported when Lagramge
     tries to load the grammar library). See how you can avoid this
